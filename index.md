## Welcome to GitHub Page for the project I've created as my Bachelor's Thesis and later presented at [BIOIMAGING '22 conference](https://http://www.bioimaging.biostec.org/).

The primary objective of this page is to present summary of the paper as well as to hold all the necessary links at one place (code, testing dataset, ...).

### Method Summary

Our method aims to bring automation in the process of orthodontics treatment. Some facts that stem from this:
  - We are dealing with difficult cases of orthodontics patients, i.e. the input meshes are obtained by scanning the dental arches of unhealthy patients with various kinds of teeth misplacements, shiftings, etc. 
  - It should not rely on *strong* PCs with modern GPUs - it should run on *normal* consumer computer (imagine for example the computer of your clinitian) in seconds.
