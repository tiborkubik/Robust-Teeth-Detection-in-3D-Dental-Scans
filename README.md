# Robust Teeth Detection in 3D Dental Scans by Automated Multi-View Landmarking
This repository is the official implementation of [link tbd](tbd) presented at [BIOIMAGING '22 Conference](https://bioimaging.scitevents.org/). 

## Abstract

Landmark detection is frequently an intermediate step in medical data analysis. More and more often, these data are represented in the form of 3D models. An example is a 3D intraoral scan of dentition used in orthodontics, where landmarking is notably challenging due to malocclusion, teeth shift, and frequent teeth missing. Whatâ€™s more, in terms of 3D data, the DNN processing comes with high memory and computational time requirements, which do not meet the needs of clinical applications. We present a robust method for tooth landmark detection based on a multi-view approach, which transforms the task into a 2D domain, where the suggested network detects landmarks by heatmap regression from several viewpoints. Additionally, we propose a post-processing based on **Multi-view Confidence** and **Maximum Heatmap Activation Confidence**, which can robustly determine whether a tooth is missing or not. Experiments have shown that the combination of **Attention U-Net**, **100 viewpoints**, and **RANSAC consensus method** is able to detect landmarks with an error of **0.75 +- 0.96 mm**. In addition to the promising accuracy, our method is robust to missing teeth, as it can correctly detect the presence of teeth in **97.68% cases**.
